                <p> Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world. The longer you live, 
                    the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain,
                    suffering and futility. Listen, everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light,
                    there will always be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors,
                    the vanquished will also exist. The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace, initiates war
                    and hatred is born in order to protect love. There are nexuses causal relationships that cannot
                    be separated. ~Madara Uchiha

                <p>	Everything that you thought had meaning: every hope, dream, or moment of happiness.
                    None of it matters as you lie bleeding out on the battlefield. None of it changes 
                    what a speeding rock does to a body, we all die. But does that mean our lives are 
                    meaningless? Does that mean that there was no point in our being born? Would you say 
                    that of our slain comrades? What about their lives? Were they meaningless?... 
                    They were not! Their memory serves as an example to us all! The courageous fallen! 
                    The anguished fallen! Their lives have meaning because we the living refuse to forget them!
                    And as we ride to certain death, we trust our successors to do the same for us! Because my
                    soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world! My soldiers
                    push forward! My soldiers scream out! My soldiers RAAAAAGE!
